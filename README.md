# Distributor

## Idea
This is to be the front-end for a generic product distribution platform. The first stage will mainly focus
on the needs of Pharmaceutical companies as it comprises the main shareholder of this project.

Will be cross-platform desktop app based on Electron.

More to be added as the project progresses.

## Project Principals
The main idea of this project is to follow Google's good coding principle, what this means.
- Any new feature **MUST** come with a test suite and an explanation why it is a good test
- All code if more than one participants in the project must be code-reviewed
- All new features / Bugs and future plans must be an issue in GitHub with a clear track on progress.
- Any new code must be in small commits!
